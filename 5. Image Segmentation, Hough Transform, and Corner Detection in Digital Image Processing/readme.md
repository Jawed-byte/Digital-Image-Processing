### **2. Hough Transform for Line and Circle Detection**
- **Hough Line Transform:**
  - Applied **Canny edge detection** before Hough Transform.
  - Detected straight lines in structured images such as roads, grids, and buildings.
  - Optimized line detection using different **threshold parameters**.

### **3. Harris Corner Detection**
- **Corner Detection Implementation:**
  - Developed a **Harris Corner Detection function** to identify distinct corners in an image.
  - Applied corner detection to structured images like **chessboards and buildings**.
  - Marked detected corners on images for better visualization.
- **Optimization and Parameter Tuning:**
  - Experimented with the sensitivity parameter **(k-value)**.
  - Observed effects of different k-values on feature detection.
